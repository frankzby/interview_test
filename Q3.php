<!-- A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.

For example, isPalindrome("Deleveled") should return true as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward. -->

<?php
class Palindrome
{
    public static function isPalindrome($word)
    {
        return NULL;
    }
}

echo Palindrome::isPalindrome('Deleveled');
